# Arduino Walking Algorithm

## Steps:
1. Lift the left leg by rotating the left hip servo forward.
2. Move the left foot forward by rotating the knee servo.
3. Lower the left leg back to the ground.
4. Shift the weight to the left leg by slightly tilting the torso.
5. Repeat the same steps with the right leg.
6. Repeat the cycle to achieve walking.

## Note
In real robots, sensors adjust balance dynamically.
